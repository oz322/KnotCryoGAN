# KnotCryoGAN
Application of Knot Theory and CryoGAN in Medical Chemistry

## Overview
The idea is to use Generative Adversarial Networks ([[CryoGAN]]) to reconstruct three-dimensional structures of molecules based on cryo-electron microscopy, incorporating known knot structures from knot theory.

## Objectives
- Improve the resolution and accuracy of reconstructed atomic structures.
- Contribute to the discovery of new knot structures in biological molecules.
- Understand the impact of topological properties of molecules on their biological functions.
- Find applications in the development of new drugs.

## Steps to Implementation
1. **Learning and Research:** Study the basics of [[Knot Theory]], cryo-electron microscopy, and deep learning.
2. **Collaboration:** Find like-minded individuals or research groups.
3. **Access to Data:** Look for open datasets of cryo-electron microscopy and information on molecular knots.
4. **Model Development:** Use Python and deep learning libraries to develop and train the CryoGAN model.
5. **Publication of Results:** Publish results in open journals or on preprint platforms.
6. **Feedback:** Seek feedback from experts and present the work at conferences.
